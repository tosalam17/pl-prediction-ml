# pl-prediction-ml  
## Overview  
This project aims to build predictive models for Premier League match outcomes. We’ll start with a simple logistic regression baseline and progressively enhance the models with feature selection and more sophisticated algorithms.  

## Goals  
- Establish a logistic regression baseline model to predict match outcomes.  
- Perform feature selection and engineering (e.g., team statistics, player form, venue effects) to improve model performance.  
- Explore potential advanced models such as random forests, gradient boosting machines, neural networks, and time-series forecasting tools.  
- Provide reproducible Jupyter notebooks and organized project structure.  

## Project Structure  
- `data/` – raw and processed datasets.  
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis, modeling, and evaluation.  
- `models/` – saved model artifacts.  
- `src/` – source code for data processing, feature engineering, and model training.  

## Getting Started  
Check out the `requirements.txt` file for the list of dependencies. Start with the sample notebook in the `notebooks/` directory for a baseline model and evaluation.
